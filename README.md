# 100 Days of Go

It's really the same thing as (100 Days of Python)[https://github.com/abaj8494/100-days-python], except this language is *statically typed* and not *object-oriented*. It is also *compiled* as opposed to *interpretted*, and thus I wish to learn it.

# Structure

The repository is split into:
0. tutorial (by go.dev)
1. tools (for (tools.abaj.ai)[tools.abaj.ai])
2. exercises (w3resource (same as the python repo))
3. book (An Idiomatic Approach to Learning Go by Jon Bodner)
